0.2.5-next:
 * change license from GPL3 to BSD-new
 * commands are now executed using a shell
 * remove the `noinit' setting (it didn't work anyway, or make much sense)
 * execute `poweroff' instead of `halt' when running `jsession-quit halt'
 * bug: running a command which reads from standard input would skip or modify
        subsequent commands
 * bug: jsession-quit wouldn't work without systemd
